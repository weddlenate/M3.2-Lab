# Letter Mark Up

This project is a markup of a letter within an HTML file. The goal was to make
it look exactly the same as the letter shown on this page 
https://boisestatecanvas.instructure.com/courses/35961/assignments/1207756?module_item_id=3592230.

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.
